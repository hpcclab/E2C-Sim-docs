        <h1>Full Report</h1>
        
        <p>
            The full report will show information about each task of the workload and the machines that they were processed on. The header at the top of the page displays the following information: 

        </p>

        <ul> 
            <li>
                <b>id: </b>
                Each task has an id number unique to itself for identification purposes.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Task Type: </b>
                Tasks can be of a certain type, denoted as T1, T2, T3, etc. Task types for the purpose of this simulator are an abstract concept that can represent different real-world applications. E.g. task type 1 is object detection, type 2 is object tracking, type 3 is voice recognition, etc.

            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Status: </b>
                The status of each task describes their outcome in the simulation, such as completed or missed (missed deadline).
            </li>

            <li>
                <b> Assigned machine: </b>
                Which machine the scheduler submitted a particular task to.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Arrival time: </b>
                When the task arrived at its submitted machine.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Start time: </b>
                When a machine began its processing of a task.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Completion time: </b>
                When a machine finished its processing of a task. Only available if the task was not canceled or missed.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Missed time: </b>
                Only available if the task missed its deadline. Displays the time the task took to reach its deadline.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Execution time: </b>
                Shows the time a task would take on any given machine (a task is assigned to only one machine by the scheduler during the simulation, but has an expected execution time written for all machines).
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Deadline: </b>
                The deadline for any task. Once this time is reached, the task is considered missed.

            </li>

        </ul>
