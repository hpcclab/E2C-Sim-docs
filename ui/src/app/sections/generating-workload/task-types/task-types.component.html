        <h1> Task Types</h1>

        <p> 
            There are many tasks in a workload, which can include multiple tasks of the same type and also tasks that differ in their type. For example, a workload may have 100 tasks of type “T1,” 50 tasks of type “T2,” and so on. Each task type defines its urgency as well, which is calculated by (1 / (deadline - execution time)).
