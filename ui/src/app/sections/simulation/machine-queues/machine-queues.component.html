        <h1>Machine Queue</h1>
        <p>
            Each machine has its own queue which tasks are submitted to. The task that arrived the earliest in time will be allotted to the queueâ€™s respective machine to be completed.
            You can click on the frame of machine queues to open a menu on the right to change the queue size. Enter a number and press enter for changes to take effect. For immediate scheduling policies, the machine queue size is automatically set to unlimited and cannot be altered.
